# Android app - *Combination of OctoRemote and OctoEverywhere project*
This app is a combination of OctoRemote and OctoEverywhere, except that I don't use either of their APIs, but I made it all myself. The Raspberry PI uploads the selected data to the Firebase cloud, app then downloads it and can work with it. In addition to full access to OctoPrint, you can set up notifications, live camera feeds and much more! My API runs on JavaScript, but is not public - maybe someday :P.
